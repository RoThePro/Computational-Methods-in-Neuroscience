# CMSC2XX: Computational Methods in Neuroscience
## Corequisite: CMSC132
## Credits: 1
## Course Description 
This course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the computational methods used in neuroscience research nowadays. 

## Topics Covered
- Application of Computer Science to Neuroscience
- Virtualizing neurons through Hoc 
- Electromagnetic properties and NEURON solver 
- Introduction to brain data 
- Processing and analysis of brain signals


## Grading

Grades will be maintained through CS grades server? ELMS?

Course percentages go as follows:

 | Percentage | Title |
 | --------- | ------- |
 | 10%		 | In-class quizzes	| 
 | 60%		 | Exercises	| 
 | 30%		 | Projects		|  

### In-class quizzes

Short quizzes will be given at the beginning of every class to ensure students are attending lecture and are following the material we are providing. These are easy points to get and students should not have a problem receiving all of them. 

### Exercises

Exercises will be used to introduce concepts and will be given every lecture and due by the next lecture. These will include small coding and biology questions that will help in reinforcing concepts learned in class. 

### Projects

Projects will be given after the completion of entire concepts such as Hoc or data analysis. As a result they will be more heavily weighted than the exercises.
