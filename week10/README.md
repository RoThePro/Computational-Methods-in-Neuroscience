# Sim4Life Intro

### Sim4Life
While you guys have been doing your Sim4Life tutorials for class here we are going to a dive into some of the ones that you have not been exposed to, that are specifically important to Functionalizing MIDA. 

### Homework
To complete the monopole simulation from Sim4Life. <br>
In order to access the Sim4Life simulations you have to follow the following steps. <br>
1. Open up Sim4Life <br>
2. Click on "help" at the top and click on the "tutorials" <br>
3. Go to Neuronal Dynamics Solver Tutorials <br>
4. Click on the one that you need to complete <br>

### Questions that you should be able to answer
- How does the simulation work?
- What does the simulation tell me?
- What does this allow me to do?
- Why would this be helpful?
- When could I extrapolate this to something else?

### Extra Readings
TBD
