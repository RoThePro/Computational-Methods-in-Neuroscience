# Computational Methods in Neuroscience

### NEURON
This week we will begin learning a new software that is necessary for computationally modeling biologically realistic neurons. HOC is the language that is primarily used with NEURON but python is also a option. NEURON is compatable with Sim4Life and later in this semester you will learn how to integrate the two together.  

### Homework
To complete the Tutorial A and Tutorial B on the MIT website linked here. <br>
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/neuron_v7.4/nrntuthtml/tutorial/tutA.html">NEURON Tutorial A</a><br>
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/neuron_v7.4/nrntuthtml/tutorial/tutB.html">NEURON Tutorial B</a>

### For your own reference: When you are doing your NEURON homeworks, unless otherwise noted, you can ask a fellow peer for help. This does not mean that you can copy their work, it means they can help you with the understanding of the material. As usual you can always come to lab and ask the peer mentors that have worked with this before. If you do copy you will not learn the material and you will only hinder your ability to contribute to the research field. I have seen many of those that worked with me fall behind and not contribute anything because they just copied. 

### Questions that you should be able to answer
- What is NEURON?
- Where did it come from, and why is this why what we use?
- What is Hodgkin-Huxley and why it is important?
- Why we compartmentalize?
- What is ModelDB and why do we care?
