# Computational Methods in Neuroscience

### NEURON
This week we will begin learning a new software that is necessary for computationally modeling biologically realistic neurons. HOC is the language that is primarily used with NEURON but python is also a option. NEURON is compatable with Sim4Life and later in this semester you will learn how to integrate the two together.  

### Homework
To complete the Tutorial A and Tutorial B on the MIT website linked here.
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/neuron_v7.4/nrntuthtml/tutorial/tutA.html">NEURON Tutorial A</a><br>
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/neuron_v7.4/nrntuthtml/tutorial/tutB.html">NEURON Tutorial B</a>

### Questions that you should be able to answer
- What is NEURON?
- Where did it come from, and why is this why what we use?
- What is Hodgkin-Huxley and why it is important?
- Why we compartmentalize?
- What is ModelDB and why do we care?
