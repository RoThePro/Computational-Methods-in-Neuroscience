# Introduction to Brain Data

## Overview 
Analyzing data from the brain can be very difficult due to how it is both collected and formatted. Invasive data collection from the brain can be quite dangerous as we don't fully know how the brain works and can in turn harm it in an attempt to gather data. Therefore we use non-invasive methods such as MRIs and EEGs. In this lecture we will cover the different types of ways to collect brain data and their respective modalities and an introduction to how we start to analyze such data.
