# NEURON into Sim4Life
This week we will end with NEURON and begin introducing concepts that are going to be needed for when we pick back up with Sim4Life. We are going to spend a bit of time focusing on the principles that are neccessary. 

### Homework
To complete the Tutorial D on the MIT website linked here. <br>
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/neuron_v7.4/nrntuthtml/tutorial/tutD.html">NEURON Tutorial D</a><br>
You might find the following link helpful for completing the above tutorial. <br>

You must also submit a document which explains what each block that you write does, in your own words. 

### Extra Credit
Go through the following paper and note the difference in code between three of the different mechanism that might need to be taken into account, submit a paper on the differences for extra credit, submit code demonstrating the difference and you will get double the extra credit:
