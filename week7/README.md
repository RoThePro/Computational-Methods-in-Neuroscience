# Theory that is necessary 
This week we will back away a bit from NEURON and begin introducing concepts that are going to be needed for when we pick back up with Sim4Life. We are going to spend a bit of time focusing on the principles that are neccessary. 

### Homework
Do the following readings



and then write a 12 Times New Roman 1.5 spaced paper on what you learned and how you can apply it. 
Unlike your other NEURON homeworks in which you could work with your classmates for this one you cannot work together and any plagirism will lead to a zero.

### Questions to Answer
TBD

### Extra Readings
