# Introduction to Signal Processing

## Overview 
Much of the data we collect from the brain is in the form of a signal. Signals give us several hundred data points per minute and we need to be able to identify patterns in the signal to make sense of it. Signal processing allows us to do this with any kinds of biological signals we may encounter.  In this lecture we will cover how we can use these algorithms to extract key features from any signal we are given to then break it down into a vector that we can then feed into a classification algorithm.
